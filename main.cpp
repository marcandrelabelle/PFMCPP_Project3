Project 3 - Part 1c / 5
Video:  Chapter 2 Part 5
User-Defined Types

Continue your work on branch Part1

Purpose: The entire purpose of this 5-part project is to get you writing C++ code that compiles and to 
reinforce the syntax habits that C++ requires.  
What you create in this project will be used as the basis of Project 5 in the course.   

************************
Part1 purpose:  Learn to write UDTs

You are going to write 10 UDTs in project3.  
    Part 1a: you will learn to think about an object in terms of its sub-objects.
    Part 1b: you will write 4 un-related UDTs in plain english
    Part 1c: you will write 1 UDT in plain english that will be made of 5 related sub-objects
    Part 1d: you will write plain-english UDTs for the 5 sub-objects that form the UDT defined in Part 1c
    Part 1e: you will convert those 10 plain-english UDTs into code that runs.
************************

1) write the 10th UDT
    come up with an object that is made of 5 smaller parts.
    These parts will not be defined using Primitives, but instead will be their own UDTs you'll define in Part 1d
    
    Here is an example:
    Cell Phone

    A Cell Phone is made up of the following 5 properties:
        Display
        Memory
        CPU
        Radio
        Applications

    A Cell Phone has 3 things it can do:
        make a call
        send a text
        run an application.

    Notice that I did not use "has a display" or "Has memory" or "has a cpu" as one of the properties of the CellPhone
    
    Writing 'has a ___" checks whether or not your object **has the ability to do something**.
    Instead, I wrote "Display" or "CPU".  These are specific objects or amounts. 
    
    In C++ terms, this means to I want you to avoid using 'bool' (has a) as a member variable type.
    Instead, prefer the other primitive types.

    When you choose your 5 smaller parts, remember that each of these 5 Sub Objects will need 
    to be defined with 5 primitive properties and 3 actions EACH.
